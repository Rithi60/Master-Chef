Lemon Loaf Recipe

Ingredients

 3 large eggs
 1 cup granulated sugar
 1 cup (8 ounces) sour cream or Greek yogurt (lite okay)
 1/2 cup canola or vegetable oil
 2 tablespoons lemon extract
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
 2 teaspoons baking powder
 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
 
Instructions
To a large bowl, add the eggs, sugar, sour cream, and whisk vigorously until smooth and combined.
Drizzle in the oil while whisking to combine.

Add the lemon zest, lemon extract, and whisk to combine. Note – I used 2 tablespoons of lemon extract because no actual lemon juice is used in the loaf and I found 2 tablespoons lemon extract necessary for full-bodied lemon flavor, but add to taste.
Add the flour, baking powder, salt, and stir until just combined, don’t overmix. Some lumps will be present and that’s okay, don’t try to stir them smooth.
Turn the batter out into prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula.
Bake for about 50 to 52 minutes, or until top is domed, set, and toothpick inserted in the center crack comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs but no batter. In the last 10 minutes of baking, tent pan with foil (loosely drape a sheet of foil over pan) to prevent excessive browning on the top and sides of bread before center cooks through.

Allow loaf to cool in pan on top of a wire rack for at least 30 minutes (I cooled 4 hours) before turning out onto rack to cool completely before glazing.
